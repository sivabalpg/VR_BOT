# VR_BOT with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Blynk IoT
This project utilizes Raspberry Pi for video streaming to a mobile phone, Arduino with a gyro sensor attached to a VR headset for collecting orientation data, and NodeMCU for controlling the camera pan and tilt. Blynk IoT platform is employed for remotely controlling the vehicle.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a virtual reality (VR) robot controlled via a mobile phone. The VR headset is equipped with a gyro sensor to detect head movements, which are then transmitted to the Raspberry Pi via Arduino. The Raspberry Pi streams live video to the mobile phone, providing the user with a VR experience. The NodeMCU receives orientation data from the Arduino and controls the pan and tilt of the camera mounted on the robot chassis. Blynk IoT platform is utilized to provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the movement of the robot.
